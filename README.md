## Abstract of the Thesis

### Background and Motivation
Around six million people die each year from the effects of smoking. It is linked to severe health issues, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as cancer, and impacts nearly every organ in the body. Smoking is the top cause of preventable diseases and deaths. Quitting smoking is the key solution, with health benefits starting just hours after the last cigarette. While 80% of smokers want to quit, only about 4% succeed without assistance, and many avoid professional help, increasing the risk of relapse. Therefore, an accessible, cost-effective, and motivating support system is needed. A serious game for smartphones, incorporating behavioral therapy and psychological approaches, could provide an effective and engaging tool to help smokers quit.

### Methodes
The serious game from the thesis aims to integrate distraction, alternatives, and psychoeducation, building on behavioral therapy principles as a supplement to professional support.
The thesis includes both theoretical and empirical analyses. The theoretical research examines existing digital smoking cessation tools, psychological and physiological effects of smoking, and the role of serious games in mental health and behavior change. Empirical research consists of online surveys and personal interviews to explore smoking behaviors, motivation to quit, and the role of mobile apps or games in the process. Findings from these analyses inform the game's requirements, psychological methods, and game elements, which are visualized in a mock-up. This mock-up is evaluated by study participants and an expert in psychology and medicine. Ultimately, the research leads to the development of key game elements and a concept that serves as the foundation for designing and prototyping this serious game.

### Results
The goal of this study was to conduct an analysis and design study as a foundation for developing a smoking cessation support app in the form of a serious game. The research focuses on identifying game elements and medical-psychological aspects that can be integrated to educate smokers and ideally help them quit. The serious game combines a real-time tracker, informative puzzles, and a dynamic game, integrating elements from existing cessation apps while visually demonstrating the body’s recovery after quitting. By targeting personal milestones, self-awareness, distraction, psychoeducation, and engagement, the game aims to boost motivation and reduce relapse rates.

### Mockup
This mockup depicts the structure of a serious for smoking cecasstion and the possibilities of how to utilize behaviour change techniques in a serious game. It was designed in the course of my bachelor thesis and was used especially for qualitative research interviews with potential end-users as well as a psychologist specialiced in addiction. The findings of the thesis and the mockup were later published the paper 'BreathIn – A Serious Game to Support Patients with Smoking Cessation: Analysis and design study for a mobile serious game to help patients quit smoking' (C. Aigner, V. Zeillinger, et al., 2023).

In the following image a snippet of the serious game is shown.
